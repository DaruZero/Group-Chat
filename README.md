# Group Chat

Group Chat is my personal project aimed at learning and implementing a simple
chat application in various programming languages. The goal is to explore
different language ecosystems by applying the same functionality and gaining
hands-on experience in diverse language paradigms.

## Definition of Done

For each implementation, my goal is to achieve the following results:

- *Create a new chat room*: Users can create a new chat room.
- *Join a chat room*: Users can join an existing chat room by providing the name
  of the chat.
- *Send a message*: Users can send messages to the chat room.
- *Receive a message*: Users can receive messages from the chat room.
- *Leave a chat room*: Users can leave the chat room.

Libraries and frameworks are allowed, but not required.

## Implementation

Check each language's README for more information on the implementation.
